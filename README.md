## Same-Page Linking

### Writing Your Own Same-Page Routes

Routes are the pieces of software that tell a web page where to go once a link is clicked. Some routes go all the way to a server to retrieve the content that's displayed on the web page, but with modern web development, many web applications have all the information one needs on the same page. This is called a "single-page-application", and it means that the routing never needs to go to a server after the page is initially loaded in order to retrieve a new page. Removing the need to wait for the server to respond with the web page's content tremendously improves the web page's loading time.

In the videos this week, you gained experience writing routes that would take you to different sections of the same page and you used a hash router to link pages together without needing to go to a server to request new information. In this exercise, you will expand on those skills to write several internal routes to the same page on the given website.

### Your Task

In this exercise, your task is to write three routes to:

1) About section of the page
2) Products section of the page
3) Checkout section of the page
The three sections, as text and a header, have been provided for you, but there are no starter routes given. You need to write the routes from scratch and make sure the header elements are labeled correctly so that you can find them with your route.
